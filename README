The BrowserPlus Uploader Widget

This is a javascript library that wraps the BrowserPlus API and that of several
services to provide a high level library which you can drop into a page to 
create a better upload experience that's (mostly) compatible with typical 
server scripts that handle HTML/browser based uploads.
